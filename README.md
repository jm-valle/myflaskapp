# myflaskapp
This repository was made with the purpose of learning the Flask framework. It will contain a basic Flask application, that I'll use to learn the framework. 
<p>At the moment, no connection with a database is made, but this will change in the near future.</p>

---
### Execution
To run this application, you'll need Python3 installed (I used Python3.6), and the Flask framework installed aswell, other than that, it will require MySQL, Flask-MySQLdb and WTForms. For this project, the database used is called 'myflaskapp', if it is necessary to change the MySQL variables, they are declared at the 'myapp.py' file. After checking that everything is installed, and that the database is set up, download this folder, and execute the file "myapp.py" which will run the Flask application.
