# myflaskapp
This repository was made with the purpose of learning the Flask framework. It will contain a basic Flask application, that I'll use to learn the framework. 
<p>At the moment, no connection with a database is made, but this will change in the near future.</p>

---
### Execution
To run this application, you'll need Python3 installed (I used Python3.6), and the Flask framework installed aswell. After checking that everything is installed, download this folder, and execute the file "myapp.py" which will run the Flask application.

For testing purposes, the file called "data.py" simulates a query result from a relational database, and it is used on the project.
